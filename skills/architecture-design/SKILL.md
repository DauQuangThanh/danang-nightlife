# Architecture Design Skill

## Overview

This skill creates comprehensive system architecture documentation for products using C4 model diagrams, Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), and quality attribute strategies. It guides product-level architecture design, documents architectural decisions, defines quality requirements, and plans deployment architecture and infrastructure.

## When to Use

- Creating comprehensive system architecture documentation for products
- Designing product-level architecture with C4 model diagrams
- Documenting architectural decisions (ADRs)
- Defining quality attribute requirements and strategies
- Planning deployment architecture and infrastructure
- When user mentions "design architecture", "system architecture", "C4 diagrams"
- Before creating feature-level implementation plans
- After creating feature specifications and ground rules

## Prerequisites

**Required Tools**:

- Python 3.8+
- Git (recommended for version control)
- File system access to project repository

**Required Files**:

- `docs/ground-rules.md` - Project principles and constraints
- Feature specifications in `specs/*/spec.md` (at least one recommended)

**Optional**:

- Existing architecture documentation to update

## Instructions

### Step 0: Specification and Requirements Gathering

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always request specification documents before starting architecture design.**

1. **Request specification documents:**
   - Ask the user to provide requirements specifications, feature documentation, or product requirements
   - Request any relevant documentation: PRD (Product Requirements Document), feature specs, user stories, or business requirements
   - If no formal documentation exists, ask the user to describe:
     - The product or system to be architected
     - Key features and functionalities
     - Expected users and stakeholders
     - Business goals and objectives
     - Technical constraints or preferences
     - Performance and scalability requirements
     - Security and compliance needs

2. **Verify ground rules exist:**
   - Check if `docs/ground-rules.md` exists in the project
   - If missing, recommend creating it first using the `project-ground-rules-setup` skill
   - Ground rules are essential for architecture design

3. **Review and confirm understanding:**
   - Summarize the requirements back to the user
   - Clarify any ambiguities or missing details
   - Confirm the scope and expected architecture deliverables
   - Identify what needs to be designed (new system, system enhancement, specific components)

4. **Only proceed to Step 1 after:**
   - Specification documents are provided and reviewed
   - Ground rules file exists or creation is confirmed
   - Requirements are clearly understood
   - User confirms readiness to start architecture design

### Step 1: Setup and Initialization

Run the setup script to prepare the architecture environment:

```bash
python3 <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/setup_architect.py
```

The script will:

- Detect repository root
- Create `docs/` and `docs/adr/` directories
- Copy architecture template to `docs/architecture.md`
- Find all feature specifications
- Return paths and metadata in JSON format

**Parse the JSON output** to get:

- `ARCH_DOC`: Path to the architecture document
- `DOCS_DIR`: Documentation directory
- `ADR_DIR`: Architecture Decision Records directory
- `SPECS_DIR`: Feature specifications directory
- `SPEC_COUNT`: Number of feature specs found
- `FEATURE_SPECS`: Array of spec file paths
- `PRODUCT_NAME`: Product/project name
- `GROUND_RULES`: Path to ground rules file

### Step 2: Load Existing Context

Before starting architecture design, load existing project context:

1. Read `docs/ground-rules.md` - Project principles, constraints, conventions
2. Read `docs/context-assessment.md` if exists - Existing codebase analysis, technical health score, identified risks, and current architecture patterns (critical for brownfield projects; informs architectural decisions and risk mitigation strategies)
3. Read all feature specifications from `FEATURE_SPECS` array
4. Load the architecture template from `ARCH_DOC` path
5. Review any existing architecture documentation

### Step 3: Execute Architecture Design Workflow

Follow the architecture design phases systematically:

#### Phase 0: Architecture Analysis & Stakeholder Identification

**Goal**: Understand requirements and stakeholders

1. **Analyze feature specifications**:
   - Read all `specs/*/spec.md` files
   - Extract common patterns and requirements
   - Identify system boundaries
   - List all external integrations mentioned

2. **Identify stakeholders** from ground-rules and specs:
   - End users and their concerns
   - Development team requirements
   - Operations team needs
   - Security and compliance requirements
   - Business stakeholders

3. **Extract architectural drivers**:
   - Business goals from feature specs
   - Quality attributes (performance, scalability, security)
   - Technical constraints from ground-rules
   - Organizational constraints
   - Assumptions and dependencies

**Output**: Complete sections "Executive Summary" and "Architecture Snapshot"

#### Phase 1: System Design & C4 Model

**Goal**: Create visual architecture using C4 model

**Prerequisites**: Phase 0 complete

Create four levels of architecture diagrams using Mermaid format. See [references/c4-and-adr-guide.md](references/c4-and-adr-guide.md) for detailed C4 model guidance, diagram examples, and when to use each level.

1. **System Context (C4 Level 1)**: User types, external systems, system boundaries
2. **Container View (C4 Level 2)**: Technical containers, technology stack, communication protocols
3. **Component View (C4 Level 3)**: Component breakdown for critical containers
4. **Code View (C4 Level 4)**: Optional - directory structure, design patterns

**Output**: Complete "System Overview (C4)" section with all Mermaid diagrams

#### Phase 2: Deployment & Infrastructure Design

**Goal**: Design production deployment architecture

**Prerequisites**: Phase 1 complete

Design deployment topology, CI/CD pipeline, and disaster recovery. See [references/c4-and-adr-guide.md](references/c4-and-adr-guide.md) for deployment architecture patterns (single-region, multi-region active-passive, multi-region active-active).

1. **Deployment architecture**: Environment topology, infrastructure components, multi-AZ setup
2. **CI/CD pipeline**: Build/test/deploy stages, deployment strategy, IaC approach
3. **Disaster recovery**: Backup strategy, RTO/RPO, recovery procedures

**Output**: Complete "Deployment Summary" section

#### Phase 3: Architecture Decisions & Quality Strategies

**Goal**: Document decisions and quality attribute strategies

**Prerequisites**: Phase 2 complete

Document ADRs for major architectural choices and map quality strategies to requirements. See [references/c4-and-adr-guide.md](references/c4-and-adr-guide.md) for:

- Detailed ADR template and examples
- When to create ADRs
- Quality attribute strategies (performance, scalability, availability, security, maintainability)
- Common architecture patterns (event-driven, API gateway, CQRS, strangler fig)

1. **Document ADRs**: For each major decision, include context, decision, rationale, consequences, alternatives
2. **Map quality strategies**: Performance, scalability, availability, security, maintainability
3. **Identify risks**: Architecture risks, technical debt, open questions

**Output**: Complete "Architecture Decisions (ADR Log)", "Quality Attributes", and "Risks & Technical Debt" sections

#### Phase 4: Agent Checklist & Finalization

**Goal**: Create actionable guidance for agents and validate completeness

**Prerequisites**: Phase 3 complete

1. **Complete Agent Checklist**:
   - **Inputs**: Payloads, headers, authentication requirements
   - **Outputs**: JSON schemas, status codes, response formats
   - **Public APIs**: List endpoints with HTTP methods
   - **Events**: Event names, payload schemas, topics/queues
   - **Data Contracts**: Key tables/fields, indexes, relationships
   - **SLOs**: Latency targets, availability targets
   - **Secrets**: Secret sources, rotation policies
   - **Config**: Environment variables, feature flags
   - **Failure Modes**: Timeouts, retries, idempotency requirements
   - **Security**: Roles, scopes, token TTLs

2. **Generate supplementary documents** (if needed):
   - `docs/architecture-overview.md` - High-level summary for stakeholders
   - `docs/deployment-guide.md` - Detailed deployment instructions
   - `docs/adr/` - Individual ADR files for version control

3. **Validation**:
   - Ensure all sections are complete
   - Verify all Mermaid diagrams render correctly
   - Check that all "ACTION REQUIRED" comments are addressed
   - Validate consistency with ground-rules
   - Confirm quality targets are measurable and specific

### Step 4: Update Agent Context

After completing the architecture, update agent-specific context files:

```bash
python3 <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/update_agent_context.py [agent-type]
```

**Supported agent types**: claude, gemini, copilot, cursor-agent, qwen, opencode, codex, windsurf, kilocode, auggie, roo, codebuddy, amp, shai, q, bob, jules, qoder, antigravity

**Omit agent type** to update all existing agent files.

### Step 5: Commit Architecture

Create a git commit with the completed architecture:

```bash
git add docs/architecture.md docs/adr/
git commit -m "docs: add system architecture documentation"
```

### Step 6: Quality Review (Recommended)

**After completing the architecture, it's highly recommended to run a quality review:**

1. **Run the architecture-design-review skill** to validate:
   - Alignment with ground rules and project goals
   - Technical feasibility and scalability
   - Completeness of architectural decisions
   - Clarity of component descriptions
   - Proper documentation of trade-offs

2. **Address any findings** from the review before proceeding to feature specifications

3. **If issues found**, update the architecture and repeat validation

**Next Steps:**

- If review passes, proceed to create feature specifications using `requirements-specification` skill
- Use `coding-standards` skill to establish code conventions
- Use `technical-detailed-design` skill for individual feature implementation planning

## Examples

### Example 1: E-Commerce Platform Architecture

**Input**: Design architecture for e-commerce platform with 3 feature specs (user management, product catalog, checkout)

**Process**:

1. Run setup script → Get architecture template and 3 specs
2. Analyze specs → Extract: user auth, product search, payment gateway
3. Identify stakeholders → End users, admins, payment provider, analytics
4. Create C4 Context → Users, Admin, System, Stripe, Google Analytics
5. Design Containers → React SPA, Node.js API, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ
6. Define Components → Auth service, Product service, Order service, Payment service
7. Plan deployment → AWS ECS, Multi-AZ, CloudFront CDN, RDS Multi-AZ
8. Document ADRs → Microservices (scalability), PostgreSQL (ACID), Redis (caching)
9. Define quality targets → 95% < 200ms, 99.9% uptime, PCI DSS compliance
10. Complete agent checklist → REST endpoints, JWT auth, event schemas

**Output**: Complete `docs/architecture.md` with C4 diagrams and 5 ADRs

### Example 2: SaaS Analytics Platform

**Input**: Design architecture for multi-tenant analytics platform

**Process**:

1. Run setup script → Get template, ground rules, 4 specs
2. Analyze requirements → Multi-tenancy, real-time dashboards, data export
3. Identify drivers → Performance (sub-second queries), Scalability (1M+ events/sec)
4. Create C4 diagrams → Context (users, data sources), Containers (Kafka, Druid, React)
5. Design deployment → Kubernetes on AWS EKS, horizontal pod autoscaling
6. Document ADRs → Event-driven architecture, Apache Druid (OLAP), tenant isolation
7. Define strategies → Sharding by tenant_id, columnar storage, query caching
8. Risk assessment → Data lake performance, multi-tenancy security
9. Complete checklist → GraphQL API, event schemas, SLOs (p95 < 100ms)

**Output**: Complete architecture with deployment diagrams and security model

## Key Rules

1. **Use Absolute Paths**: All file operations must use absolute paths
2. **Product-Level Scope**: Architecture goes to `docs/architecture.md` (product-level, NOT feature-level)
3. **Mermaid Diagrams Required**: All diagrams MUST use Mermaid format embedded in markdown
4. **ADRs Are Mandatory**: Every major architectural decision MUST have an ADR
5. **Measurable Targets**: Quality attribute targets must be specific and measurable (not "fast", but "95% < 200ms")
6. **Reference Specs**: Document which feature specs influenced each architectural decision
7. **Respect Ground Rules**: Ground-rules constraints MUST be respected; violations must be justified
8. **Concrete Values**: Use concrete numbers, versions, URLs (not placeholders)
9. **One Architecture Per Product**: This is product-level, not feature-level planning

## Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Format

See [references/c4-and-adr-guide.md](references/c4-and-adr-guide.md) for detailed ADR template with complete example.

## Edge Cases

### Case 1: No Feature Specifications Yet

**Handling**: Create architecture based on ground-rules and user input only. Focus on high-level system design. Update architecture after feature specs are created.

### Case 2: Updating Existing Architecture

**Handling**: Read existing `docs/architecture.md`, preserve existing ADRs, add new sections for changes. Create new ADRs for new decisions. Mark superseded ADRs appropriately.

### Case 3: Microservices vs Monolith Decision

**Handling**: Consider: team size, deployment frequency, scalability needs, organizational structure. Document decision in ADR with clear rationale. Default to monolith for small teams unless specific drivers require microservices.

## Error Handling

### Error: Template Not Found

**Action**: Script creates basic architecture file. Manually structure document using standard sections from skill documentation.

### Error: Mermaid Diagram Syntax Error

**Action**: Validate Mermaid syntax using online editor (mermaid.live). Fix syntax errors. Test rendering in markdown preview.

## Scripts

### setup_architect.py

Creates architecture environment and copies template:

```bash
python3 <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/setup_architect.py
```

**Returns**: JSON with paths (ARCH_DOC, DOCS_DIR, ADR_DIR, SPECS_DIR, SPEC_COUNT, FEATURE_SPECS, PRODUCT_NAME, GROUND_RULES)

### update_agent_context.py

Updates agent-specific context with architecture decisions:

```bash
python3 <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/update_agent_context.py [agent-type]
```

## Templates

### arch-template.md

Located at: `<SKILL_DIR>/templates/arch-template.md`

Streamlined architecture template with sections for C4 diagrams, deployment, ADRs, and quality attributes.
