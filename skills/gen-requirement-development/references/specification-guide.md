# Requirements Specification Guide

## Detailed Section Requirements

### Mandatory vs Optional Sections

**Mandatory Sections** (must be completed for every feature):

- Feature Name
- Overview
- User Scenarios
- Functional Requirements
- Success Criteria

**Optional Sections** (include only when relevant):

- Key Entities (only if data/domain modeling is involved)
- Assumptions (document any assumptions made)
- Out of Scope (clarify what's explicitly excluded)
- Dependencies (external systems or prerequisite features)

**Section Handling Rule:**

- If a section doesn't apply to your feature, remove it entirely
- Never leave sections with just "N/A" or "Not applicable"
- Keep the specification clean and focused

## Detailed Validation Criteria

### Content Quality Checks

**No Implementation Details:**

- ❌ Bad: "Use bcrypt for password hashing"
- ❌ Bad: "Store sessions in Redis"
- ❌ Bad: "Implement with React hooks"
- ✅ Good: "Passwords must be securely hashed"
- ✅ Good: "User sessions persist across browser restarts"
- ✅ Good: "Interface responds to user interactions"

**Focus on User Value:**

- ❌ Bad: "Deploy using Docker containers"
- ❌ Bad: "Use PostgreSQL database"
- ✅ Good: "Users can access from multiple devices"
- ✅ Good: "Data persists reliably"

**Non-Technical Language:**

- ❌ Bad: "API returns JSON with status codes"

- ✅ Good: "System provides status updates"
- ✅ Good: "Interface stays current with latest data"

### Requirement Completeness

**Testable Requirements:**

- Each requirement must be verifiable
- Must have clear acceptance criteria
- Must be measurable or observable
- Example: "User can reset password" ✅
- Example: "System is user-friendly" ❌ (not measurable)

**Unambiguous Requirements:**

- No vague terms: "fast", "easy", "intuitive"
- Use specific metrics: "within 2 seconds", "in 3 clicks"
- Avoid subjective terms without criteria

**Success Criteria Properties:**

- **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)
  - ❌ "Search is fast"
  - ✅ "Search results appear in under 1 second"
- **Technology-agnostic**: No frameworks, languages, databases
  - ❌ "React components load quickly"
  - ✅ "Pages load in under 2 seconds"
- **User-focused**: Outcomes from user/business perspective
  - ❌ "Redis cache hit rate above 80%"
  - ✅ "90% of repeat queries return instantly"
- **Verifiable**: Can be tested without knowing implementation
  - ❌ "Code coverage above 80%"
  - ✅ "All user scenarios complete without errors"

## Clarification Management

### When to Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Only use when:**

1. **Scope Impact**: Decision significantly changes feature scope
   - Example: "Should this support multiple languages?"
   - Impact: Internationalization affects entire feature
2. **Security/Privacy**: Legal or financial implications
   - Example: "How long should we retain user data?"
   - Impact: Compliance requirements vary by region
3. **Multiple Interpretations**: No clear reasonable default
   - Example: "Should 'active users' mean daily or monthly?"
   - Impact: Fundamentally different metrics
4. **User Experience**: Fundamentally different UX approaches
   - Example: "Should search be real-time or manual?"
   - Impact: Changes interaction model

**Don't use for:**

- Technical implementation (make reasonable assumptions)
- Standard industry practices (use common patterns)
- Minor UX details (use best practices)
- Performance targets (use industry standards)

### Reasonable Defaults (Make Assumptions)

**Data Retention:**

- User data: Industry-standard GDPR compliance (e.g., 2-7 years)
- Session data: 30 days
- Log data: 90 days
- Backup data: 30 days

**Performance Targets:**

- Page load: < 3 seconds (web), < 1 second (mobile)
- API response: < 500ms
- Search results: < 1 second
- Form submission: < 2 seconds

**Error Handling:**

- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Fallback to cached data when possible

**Authentication:**

- Session-based for web apps
- OAuth2 for third-party integrations
- Token expiration: 24 hours
- Refresh token: 30 days

**Integration Patterns:**

- RESTful APIs for web services
- Webhooks for event notifications
- Polling: Every 30-60 seconds for non-critical updates

### Clarification Question Format

When you must use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION], format questions as:

```markdown
## Question [N]: [Topic]

**Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]

**What we need to know**: [Specific question]

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A      | [First option] | [Impact on feature] |
| B      | [Second option] | [Impact on feature] |
| C      | [Third option] | [Impact on feature] |
| Custom | Your own answer | [How to provide it] |

**Your choice**: _[Wait for response]_
```

**Limit**: Maximum 3 clarification questions per feature

## Validation Checklist Details

### Content Quality Validation

**Check: No Implementation Details**

- Scan entire spec for technology names
- Look for: language names, framework names, database names, cloud providers
- Verify: Focus is on behavior and outcomes, not tools

**Check: Focused on User Value**

- Each requirement should answer "What can users do?"
- Success criteria should measure user or business outcomes
- Technical metrics (cache hits, API calls) should be converted to user metrics

**Check: Written for Non-Technical Stakeholders**

- Avoid technical jargon
- Use domain language, not engineering language
- Should be understandable by product managers, designers, QA

## Common Validation Failures and Fixes

### Failure: "Requirements mention React, PostgreSQL, AWS"

**Fix**: Rewrite in terms of user capabilities:

- "React component" → "Interface element"
- "PostgreSQL query" → "Data retrieval"
- "AWS Lambda function" → "Background process"

### Failure: "Success criteria not measurable"

**Fix**: Add specific metrics:

- "Fast response" → "Response within 2 seconds"
- "High availability" → "99.9% uptime"
- "Many concurrent users" → "100 concurrent users"

### Failure: "Requirements not testable"

**Fix**: Add observable outcomes:

- "System is secure" → "Unauthorized users cannot access data"
- "Code is maintainable" → "Features can be modified without breaking tests"

### Failure: "[NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain"

**Fix**: Present questions to user with format above, wait for responses, update spec

### Failure: "Missing acceptance scenarios"

**Fix**: Add user flow with:

1. User starts at [state]
2. User performs [action]
3. System responds with [outcome]
4. User sees [result]

## Iteration Strategy

### First Iteration

- Focus on removing implementation details
- Add metrics to success criteria
- Ensure all mandatory sections present

### Second Iteration

- Verify requirements are testable
- Check acceptance scenarios are complete
- Resolve any remaining [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

### Third Iteration (Final)

- Final scan for technology leakage
- Verify all checklist items
- Document any remaining issues in notes

### After 3 Iterations

- If still failing, document specific issues
- Provide detailed explanation to user
- Suggest manual review areas
- Offer to proceed with warnings
