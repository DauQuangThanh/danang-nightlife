# Project Consistency Analysis Skill

## Overview

This skill performs comprehensive, non-destructive consistency and quality analysis across project specification artifacts (spec.md, design.md, tasks.md). It identifies duplications, ambiguities, underspecifications, ground-rules violations, coverage gaps, and inconsistencies before implementation begins. The analysis is strictly read-only and produces structured reports with actionable recommendations.

## When to Use

- After completing task breakdown (tasks.md generated)
- Before starting implementation
- Validating project artifact consistency
- Checking ground-rules compliance
- Identifying requirements coverage gaps
- Detecting ambiguous or duplicate requirements
- User mentions: "analyze project", "check consistency", "validate artifacts", "quality analysis", "check spec"

## Prerequisites

- **Required documents in feature directory**:
  - `spec.md` - Feature requirements and user stories (Required)
  - `design.md` - Technical design and architecture (Required)
  - `tasks.md` - Implementation task breakdown (Required)
- **Ground rules document** (Highly recommended):
  - `docs/ground-rules.md` - Project principles and guidelines
- **Product-level documentation** (Optional):
  - `docs/architecture.md` - Architectural patterns and decisions
  - `docs/standards.md` - Coding and design standards
- **Tools**: bash (Unix/Linux/macOS) or PowerShell (Windows) for running prerequisite checks

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check Prerequisites and Load Artifacts

Run the prerequisite check script to verify required documents exist:

**Python 3 (Cross-platform):**

```bash
cd /path/to/repo
python3 skills/project-consistency-analysis/scripts/check-analysis-prerequisites.py --json
```

Parse the output to extract:

- `FEATURE_DIR`: Absolute path to feature directory
- `SPEC_FILE`: Path to spec.md
- `DESIGN_FILE`: Path to design.md
- `TASKS_FILE`: Path to tasks.md
- `GROUND_RULES_AVAILABLE`: Boolean indicating if ground-rules.md exists
- `ARCHITECTURE_AVAILABLE`: Boolean indicating if architecture.md exists
- `STANDARDS_AVAILABLE`: Boolean indicating if standards.md exists

### Step 2: Load Artifacts with Progressive Disclosure

Load only minimal necessary context from each artifact to maintain token efficiency:

#### From spec.md (Required)

- **Overview/Context**: Project purpose and scope
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system must do
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability, etc.
- **User Stories**: User actions with acceptance criteria
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual scenarios and handling (if present)

#### From design.md (Required)

- **Architecture/Stack Choices**: Technology decisions
- **Data Model References**: Entity definitions
- **Phases**: Development phases or milestones
- **Technical Constraints**: Limitations and dependencies

#### From tasks.md (Required)

- **Task IDs**: Unique identifiers (T001, T002, etc.)
- **Task Descriptions**: What each task accomplishes
- **Phase Grouping**: Which phase each task belongs to
- **Parallel Markers**: [P] indicators for parallel execution
- **Referenced File Paths**: Files to create/modify

#### From docs/ground-rules.md (If Available)

- **Principle Names**: Core project principles
- **MUST/SHOULD Statements**: Normative requirements
- **Quality Gates**: Required checkpoints
- **Prohibited Practices**: What to avoid

#### From docs/architecture.md (If Available)

- **Architectural Patterns**: Design patterns to follow
- **Technology Stack**: Approved technologies
- **Component Organization**: System structure
- **Quality Attribute Requirements**: Performance, security goals
- **ADRs**: Architecture Decision Records

#### From docs/standards.md (If Available)

- **UI Naming Conventions**: Component, prop, event names
- **Code Naming Conventions**: Variables, functions, classes
- **File Structure Standards**: Directory organization
- **API Design Standards**: Endpoint conventions

### Step 3: Build Semantic Models

Create internal representations for analysis (do not include in output):

#### Requirements Inventory

- Extract each functional and non-functional requirement
- Generate stable keys using slug format (e.g., "User can upload file" → `user-can-upload-file`)
- Track requirement location (file, line number)

#### User Story/Action Inventory

- Extract discrete user actions
- Map acceptance criteria to each story
- Identify story dependencies

#### Task Coverage Mapping

- Map each task to one or more requirements or stories
- Use keyword matching and explicit references (IDs, key phrases)
- Track unmapped tasks and uncovered requirements

#### Ground-Rules Rule Set

- Extract principle names
- Identify MUST and SHOULD normative statements
- Create validation criteria

### Step 4: Detection Passes (High-Signal Analysis)

Focus on actionable findings. Limit to 50 findings total; summarize overflow. See [references/analysis-patterns.md](references/analysis-patterns.md) for detailed detection algorithms, examples, and patterns.

**Six Detection Passes**:

**A. Duplication Detection**: Near-duplicate requirements (>70% similarity) that should be consolidated

**B. Ambiguity Detection**: Vague adjectives, placeholders, unmeasurable criteria

**C. Underspecification Detection**: Incomplete requirements, missing acceptance criteria, undefined error handling

**D. Ground-Rules Alignment**: Validate MUST/SHOULD principles, prohibited practices, quality gates

**E. Coverage Gap Detection**: Requirements without tasks, orphan tasks, missing NFR coverage

**F. Inconsistency Detection**: Terminology drift, data mismatches, technology conflicts, architecture/standards violations

### Step 5: Severity Assignment

Assign severity levels to prioritize findings. See [references/analysis-patterns.md](references/analysis-patterns.md) for detailed severity decision tree and examples.

**CRITICAL**: Ground-rules MUST violations, missing core artifacts, zero coverage for baseline functionality, contradictory requirements, major security/data gaps. **Action: Must resolve before implementation**

**HIGH**: Duplicate/conflicting requirements, ambiguous security/performance, untestable criteria, missing NFR coverage, architecture/standards violations. **Action: Should resolve before implementation**

**MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, underspecified edge cases, minor coverage gaps, task ordering issues with workarounds. **Action: Can proceed but recommend fixes**

**LOW**: Style improvements, minor redundancy, optional documentation gaps, cosmetic inconsistencies. **Action: Optional, can defer**

### Step 6: Generate Analysis Report

Create structured report using `templates/analysis-report.md`. See [references/analysis-patterns.md](references/analysis-patterns.md) for detailed report templates and formatting.

**Report Sections**:

1. **Executive Summary**: Status, total findings by severity, coverage %, key metrics
2. **Findings Table**: ID, Category, Severity, Location(s), Summary, Recommendation
3. **Coverage Summary**: Requirements with/without tasks, orphan tasks
4. **Ground-Rules Alignment Issues**: CRITICAL violations (if any)
5. **Unmapped Tasks**: Tasks without requirements (if any)
6. **Metrics Summary**: Requirements, tasks, coverage %, findings counts

### Step 7: Provide Next Actions

Based on analysis results, recommend next steps. See [references/analysis-patterns.md](references/analysis-patterns.md) for decision tree and next actions template.

**If CRITICAL Issues**: Stop, resolve critical issues, suggest fix commands, re-run analysis

**If HIGH/MEDIUM Issues**: Proceed with caution, address high-priority items, provide improvement suggestions

**If LOW/No Issues**: Clear to proceed, optional improvements can be deferred, suggest `/phoenix.implement`

### Step 8: Offer Remediation Suggestions

After presenting the report, ask: **"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?"**

**Important**: Do NOT apply edits automatically. This skill is strictly read-only.

If user agrees, provide specific edit recommendations with exact file paths, line numbers, "Change from" → "Change to" examples, and rationale. See [references/analysis-patterns.md](references/analysis-patterns.md) for remediation suggestion format and examples.

## Operating Principles

### Strictly Read-Only

- **NEVER** modify any files during analysis
- **NEVER** auto-apply fixes or remediation
- **ALWAYS** output findings to console or report file only

### Token Efficiency

- **Minimal High-Signal Tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally, don't dump all content
- **Limited Output**: Cap findings at 50 rows, summarize overflow
- **Deterministic Results**: Rerunning without changes produces consistent IDs and counts

### Analysis Quality

- **No Hallucination**: If sections are missing, report accurately - don't invent content
- **Prioritize Ground-Rules**: Violations are automatically CRITICAL
- **Concrete Examples**: Cite specific instances, not generic patterns
- **Graceful Zero-Issues**: Emit success report with coverage statistics if no issues found

### Ground-Rules Authority

Ground rules from `docs/ground-rules.md` are **non-negotiable**:

- MUST principles cannot be overridden or reinterpreted
- Ground-rules conflicts are automatically CRITICAL
- Changing principles requires explicit ground-rules update (separate process)
- Do not dilute or ignore principles in analysis

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Analysis with Issues

**Input:**

```bash
python3 skills/project-consistency-analysis/scripts/check-analysis-prerequisites.py --json
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "feature_dir": "/path/to/specs/feature-name",
  "spec_file": "/path/to/specs/feature-name/spec.md",
  "design_file": "/path/to/specs/feature-name/design.md",
  "tasks_file": "/path/to/specs/feature-name/tasks.md",
  "ground_rules_available": true,
  "architecture_available": true,
  "standards_available": true
}
```

**Analysis Results:**

- 3 Critical issues (1 ground-rules violation, 2 missing coverage)
- 5 High issues (ambiguous requirements)
- 8 Medium issues (terminology drift)
- 2 Low issues (style improvements)
- Coverage: 85% (45/53 requirements have tasks)

**Recommendation:** Resolve critical issues before implementation

### Example 2: Clean Analysis (No Issues)

**Analysis Results:**

- 0 Critical issues
- 0 High issues
- 2 Medium issues (minor terminology inconsistencies)
- 1 Low issue (optional documentation)
- Coverage: 100% (all requirements have tasks)

**Recommendation:** Ready to proceed with implementation

## Edge Cases

- **Missing tasks.md**: Report error, suggest running task generation first
- **Malformed YAML frontmatter**: Attempt to parse, report parsing errors
- **Empty artifacts**: Report as critical underspecification
- **No ground-rules.md**: Skip ground-rules validation, note absence in report
- **Architecture/standards.md missing**: Skip those validation passes
- **Circular references**: Detect and report as inconsistency
- **Very large artifacts**: Use sampling or focus on high-priority sections

## Error Handling

- **Script execution fails**: Report exact error, check working directory
- **Invalid JSON from script**: Parse as text and extract paths manually
- **Missing required documents**: List what's missing, provide commands to create
- **Cannot read artifacts**: Report access issues, suggest checking permissions
- **Analysis timeout**: Report partial results, suggest breaking down analysis
- **Memory constraints**: Use streaming analysis for large artifacts

## Scripts

This skill includes a cross-platform script for checking analysis prerequisites:

### Python 3 Script (Cross-platform)

```bash
python3 skills/project-consistency-analysis/scripts/check-analysis-prerequisites.py [--json] [feature-directory]
```

**Features:**

- Locates feature directory and required artifacts
- Verifies spec.md, design.md, tasks.md exist
- Checks for ground-rules.md, architecture.md, standards.md in memory/docs directories
- JSON and human-readable output with color coding
- Cross-platform compatibility (works on Linux, macOS, Windows)

### Script Output Format

Both scripts output JSON with:

- `success`: Boolean indicating if prerequisites met
- `feature_dir`: Path to feature directory
- `spec_file`: Path to spec.md
- `design_file`: Path to design.md
- `tasks_file`: Path to tasks.md
- `ground_rules_available`: Boolean for ground-rules.md
- `architecture_available`: Boolean for architecture.md
- `standards_available`: Boolean for standards.md
- `error`: Error message if prerequisites not met

## Templates

- `templates/analysis-report.md`: Structure for comprehensive consistency analysis reports

## Guidelines

1. **Be Thorough But Focused**: Analyze systematically, prioritize high-impact findings
2. **Be Objective**: Report facts, not opinions
3. **Be Specific**: Reference exact locations (file:line)
4. **Prioritize Severity**: Use severity levels consistently
5. **Explain Rationale**: Why something is an issue, not just what
6. **Suggest Solutions**: Provide actionable recommendations
7. **Respect Context**: Understand project constraints
8. **Never Modify Files**: Strictly read-only analysis
9. **Use Examples**: Show concrete instances, not abstractions
10. **Report Gracefully**: Handle zero-issues case positively
