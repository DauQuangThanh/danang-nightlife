### 12. Placeholders & Ambiguities

**What to Check:**

- No TODO markers remain
- Ambiguous adjectives quantified

**Examples of Clear:**

- All sections complete (no TODOs)
- "Fast" replaced with "< 2 seconds"
- "Scalable" replaced with "supports 10K concurrent users"

**Examples of Unclear:**

- Contains TODO markers
- Uses vague terms: "robust", "intuitive", "fast"
- Sections marked [TBD]

## Question Formulation Guidelines

### Multiple-Choice Questions

**Good Questions:**

- Have 2-5 clear options
- Each option is implementable
- Options are mutually exclusive
- Cover the reasonable solution space

**Example:**

```markdown
## Question 1: Session Expiration

**Context**: Spec doesn't specify session timeout policy.

**Recommended:** Option B - Balances security with user convenience

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | 30 minutes idle timeout (high security) |
| B | 24 hours idle timeout (standard) |
| C | 7 days idle timeout (low security, high convenience) |
| Short | Provide different timeout value |
```

**Bad Questions:**

- Too many options (>5)
- Options overlap or are vague
- Missing "Short" option for custom answers

### Short-Answer Questions

**Good Questions:**

- Can be answered in ≤5 words
- Have a clear suggested answer
- Are not open-ended

**Example:**

```markdown
## Question 2: Data Retention

**Context**: No retention policy specified for user activity logs.

**Suggested:** 90 days - Standard for analytics

Format: Short answer (≤5 words)
```

**Bad Questions:**

- Require long explanations
- No suggested answer
- Too open-ended

## Error Recovery Strategies

### Recovery: Partial Integration Failure

**Issue**: Answer integrated into Clarifications but not into target section

**Strategy:**

1. Log the failure reason
2. Continue with next question (don't block)
3. Report at end: "Manual integration needed for Q[N] in [section]"
4. Provide guidance on where/how to integrate

### Recovery: Spec File Lock/Permission Issue

**Issue**: Can't write to spec file

**Strategy:**

1. Store all answers in memory
2. Complete questioning phase
3. Attempt final atomic write
4. If still fails: Output all answers to console/file for manual integration
5. Report: "Answers collected but file write failed"

### Recovery: Git Conflict

**Issue**: Spec file changed by another process during review

**Strategy:**

1. Spec file already saved with current changes
2. Attempt commit
3. If conflict: Report "Commit failed due to conflict, resolve manually"
4. Provide merge guidance
5. Continue with completion report

### Recovery: Invalid User Answer

**Issue**: User provides answer that doesn't fit format

**Strategy:**

1. Don't count as new question
2. Request clarification: "Please provide [specific format]"
3. Give example if helpful
4. Retry until valid answer or user explicitly skips

### Recovery: Markdown Parsing Failure

**Issue**: Spec has malformed markdown

**Strategy:**

1. Attempt best-effort parsing
2. Identify problematic section if possible
3. Skip that section in coverage scan
4. Report: "Skipped [section] due to parsing error"
5. Continue with remaining sections
6. Suggest manual markdown fix
