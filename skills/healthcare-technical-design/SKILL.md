# Healthcare Technical Design Skill

## Overview

This skill guides you through a structured implementation planning workflow specifically for healthcare systems, creating comprehensive technical design artifacts that ensure HIPAA compliance, patient data privacy, and adherence to medical regulatory requirements. It follows a phased approach from healthcare-specific research through design to contract generation, ensuring all technical decisions are documented, compliant with healthcare standards, and aligned with medical system architecture.

## When to Use

- Planning implementation for new healthcare features or medical components
- Creating technical specifications and design documents for healthcare systems
- Designing HIPAA-compliant data models and API contracts for patient data
- Researching healthcare technical decisions and regulatory requirements
- Aligning medical feature design with existing healthcare architecture
- Documenting implementation approaches for healthcare applications
- Ensuring compliance with HIPAA, FDA, CMS, and other healthcare regulations
- When user requests "design healthcare feature", "create medical technical plan", "plan healthcare implementation", "design HIPAA-compliant API", or "design patient data system"

**Next Steps After Creating Healthcare Technical Design:**

- Use `healthcare-task-management` skill to create HIPAA-aware task breakdown (tasks.md)
- Use `e2e-test-design` skill for end-to-end test planning with healthcare scenarios
- Use `coding` skill to execute implementation following healthcare coding standards
- Use `bug-analysis` skill if issues are discovered during development
- Use `healthcare-requirements-specification` skill if requirements need refinement

## Prerequisites

**Required:**

- Healthcare feature specification or requirements document available (preferably created with healthcare-requirements-specification skill)
- Templates provided with this skill (in `templates/` directory)
- Git repository with feature branch (format: `N-feature-name`, e.g., `1-patient-portal`)
- Feature directory at `specs/N-feature-name/` with `spec.md` file
- Compliance framework document (`docs/compliance-framework.md`) for HIPAA and regulatory requirements

**Optional (workspace-level enhancements):**

- `docs/healthcare-ground-rules.md` - Healthcare project constraints and standards
- `docs/healthcare-architecture.md` - Healthcare architectural decisions and patterns
- `docs/healthcare-standards.md` - Medical data standards and interoperability requirements

**Important:** Healthcare technical design must be done on a feature branch. The design artifacts will be created in `specs/N-feature-name/` directory and must comply with healthcare regulations.

## Instructions

### Step 0: Healthcare Specification and Compliance Verification

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always request healthcare specification documents and verify compliance requirements before starting technical design.**

1. **Request healthcare specification documents:**
   - Ask the user to provide healthcare feature specifications, medical requirements documents, or clinical workflows
   - Request any relevant healthcare documentation: feature specs, HIPAA requirements, clinical workflows, regulatory constraints, or medical design specifications
   - If no formal documentation exists, ask the user to describe:
     - The healthcare feature or medical component to be designed
     - Patient workflows and clinical interactions
     - Protected Health Information (PHI) handling requirements
     - HIPAA Security Rule and Privacy Rule compliance needs
     - Integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems
     - Medical device or FDA-regulated software requirements
     - Patient safety and clinical decision support needs

2. **Verify healthcare compliance framework exists:**
   - Check if `docs/compliance-framework.md` exists (for HIPAA, FDA, CMS requirements)
   - Check if `docs/healthcare-standards.md` exists (for medical data standards)
   - If missing, note that design may need additional healthcare compliance guidance

3. **Review and confirm understanding:**
   - Summarize the healthcare requirements back to the user
   - Clarify any ambiguities or missing medical details
   - Confirm the scope and expected healthcare technical design deliverables
   - Identify what needs to be designed (PHI data models, HIPAA-compliant APIs, medical workflows)

4. **Only proceed to Step 1 after:**
   - Healthcare specification documents are provided and reviewed
   - Compliance requirements are clearly understood
   - User confirms readiness to start healthcare technical design

### Step 1: Setup and Healthcare Context Loading

1. **Create healthcare design directory structure** manually or using the following commands:

   **Manual Directory Creation:**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p specs/N-feature-name/design
   mkdir -p specs/N-feature-name/research
   mkdir -p specs/N-feature-name/compliance
   mkdir -p specs/N-feature-name/data-models
   mkdir -p specs/N-feature-name/api-contracts
   mkdir -p specs/N-feature-name/implementation
   mkdir -p specs/N-feature-name/testing
   mkdir -p specs/N-feature-name/documentation
   ```

   Replace `N-feature-name` with your actual feature branch name (e.g., `1-patient-portal`).

2. **Copy healthcare-specific templates** to the design directory:

   ```bash
   cp skills/healthcare-technical-design/templates/healthcare-design-template.md specs/N-feature-name/design/design-document.md
   cp skills/healthcare-technical-design/templates/healthcare-research-template.md specs/N-feature-name/research/research-findings.md
   cp skills/healthcare-technical-design/templates/healthcare-data-model-template.md specs/N-feature-name/data-models/data-model.md
   cp skills/healthcare-technical-design/templates/healthcare-api-contract-template.md specs/N-feature-name/api-contracts/api-contract.md
   cp skills/healthcare-technical-design/templates/healthcare-compliance-check-template.md specs/N-feature-name/compliance/compliance-checklist.md
   cp skills/healthcare-technical-design/templates/healthcare-quickstart-template.md specs/N-feature-name/implementation/quickstart-guide.md
   ```

3. **Load required healthcare context**:
   - Read healthcare feature specification/requirements from `specs/N-feature-name/spec.md`
   - Load `docs/healthcare-ground-rules.md` if exists (optional - for healthcare standards)
   - Load `docs/healthcare-architecture.md` if exists (optional - for healthcare patterns)
   - Load `docs/compliance-framework.md` (required - for HIPAA and regulatory requirements)
   - Note current git branch: `N-feature-name`

4. **Review healthcare design document template**:
   - Template copied to `specs/N-feature-name/design/design-document.md`
   - Review healthcare-specific structure and sections
   - Begin filling in feature name and basic healthcare context

### Step 2: Healthcare Technical Context Analysis

1. **Extract key healthcare information from requirements**:
   - Functional requirements (clinical workflows, patient interactions)
   - Non-functional requirements (HIPAA compliance, patient safety, performance)
   - PHI data handling and privacy requirements
   - Regulatory compliance needs (HIPAA, FDA, CMS)
   - Medical device integration requirements
   - Clinical decision support needs

2. **Document in design.md Healthcare Technical Context section**:
   - List all known healthcare technical details
   - Mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION"
   - Reference healthcare ground-rules that apply
   - Note healthcare architectural patterns from healthcare-architecture.md (if available)
   - Document PHI data elements and privacy requirements

3. **Evaluate against healthcare compliance framework**:
   - Check HIPAA Security Rule compliance (technical safeguards)
   - Check HIPAA Privacy Rule compliance (data usage and disclosure)
   - Document any conflicts or exceptions needed
   - Justify deviations if necessary with clinical rationale

### Step 3: Phase 0 - Healthcare Research & Regulatory Resolution

**Goal**: Resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION items and ensure regulatory compliance before proceeding to design

1. **Identify healthcare research tasks from Technical Context**:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → create healthcare research question
   - For each technology choice → identify HIPAA-compliant best practices
   - For each PHI handling requirement → research privacy protection patterns
   - For each medical integration → research healthcare interoperability standards (HL7, FHIR)
   - Review healthcare-architecture.md for relevant medical decisions and patterns

2. **Conduct healthcare research and document findings**:
   - Research template copied to `specs/N-feature-name/research/research-findings.md`
   - Template structure provided in `templates/healthcare-research-template.md`
   - For each healthcare decision, document:
     - **Decision**: What was chosen for healthcare context
     - **Rationale**: Why it was chosen considering patient safety and compliance
     - **HIPAA Impact**: How it affects PHI protection and privacy
     - **Regulatory Alignment**: Compliance with FDA, CMS, or other regulations
     - **Alternatives Considered**: What else was evaluated for healthcare use
     - **Architecture Alignment**: How it aligns with existing healthcare architecture
     - **Clinical Safety**: Impact on patient safety and clinical workflows
     - **Trade-offs**: Pros and cons in healthcare context
     - **References**: Healthcare standards and regulatory sources consulted

3. **Update design.md with healthcare research outcomes**:
   - Replace all NEEDS CLARIFICATION with concrete healthcare decisions
   - Link to research.md for regulatory and clinical details

### Step 4: Phase 1 - Healthcare Data Model Design

**Prerequisites**: All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved in Phase 0

1. **Extract healthcare entities from requirements**:
   - Identify medical domain objects (Patient, Provider, Encounter, Medication)
   - List PHI and non-PHI attributes for each entity
   - Define relationships considering HIPAA privacy rules
   - Identify clinical state transitions and workflow states

2. **Create healthcare data model document**:
   - Data model template copied to `specs/N-feature-name/data-models/data-model.md`
   - Template structure provided in `templates/healthcare-data-model-template.md`
   - For each healthcare entity document:
     - Entity name and clinical description
     - PHI classification and privacy level
     - Fields with types, constraints, and HIPAA considerations
     - Validation rules for medical data integrity
     - Relationships to other entities (considering access controls)
     - Clinical state machine (if applicable)

3. **Add healthcare-specific diagrams** (if helpful):
   - Entity-relationship diagrams with PHI markings
   - Clinical workflow diagrams
   - Data flow diagrams showing PHI protection
   - Audit and access control diagrams

### Step 5: Phase 1 - HIPAA-Compliant API Contract Generation

1. **Identify healthcare API endpoints from requirements**:
   - For each clinical user action → determine HIPAA-compliant endpoint
   - For each PHI data query → determine access-controlled read endpoint
   - For each medical data mutation → determine audited write endpoint
   - Consider role-based access control (RBAC) for healthcare providers

2. **Design HIPAA-compliant API contracts**:
   - API contract template copied to `specs/N-feature-name/api-contracts/api-contract.md`
   - Template structure provided in `templates/healthcare-api-contract-template.md`
   - Create additional contract files in contracts directory as needed
   - Follow healthcare interoperability standards (FHIR, HL7)
   - Include:
     - Endpoint path/operation with clinical context
     - HTTP method / FHIR resource type
     - Request schema with PHI markings
     - Response schema with privacy considerations
     - Error responses following healthcare standards
     - Authentication and authorization requirements
     - Audit logging requirements for PHI access
   - Follow API design patterns from healthcare-architecture.md (if available)

3. **Generate healthcare-standard schemas**:
   - Create FHIR resources or HL7 messages where applicable
   - Validate schema syntax against healthcare standards
   - Add clinical examples for each endpoint
   - Include privacy metadata and consent handling

### Step 6: Create Healthcare Implementation Quickstart Guide

1. **Document healthcare implementation approach**:
   - Create quickstart file at `specs/N-feature-name/implementation/quickstart-guide.md`
   - Include:
     - High-level implementation steps for healthcare context
     - HIPAA-compliant technology stack for this medical feature
     - Key files/modules to create/modify with security considerations
     - Healthcare integration points and interoperability requirements
     - PHI data handling and privacy protection strategies
     - Testing strategy including penetration testing and HIPAA validation
     - Deployment considerations for medical environments
     - Clinical safety and validation procedures

2. **Add healthcare code examples**:
   - Show HIPAA-compliant code patterns
   - Provide PHI handling and encryption examples
   - Reference healthcare design decisions from research.md
   - Include audit logging and access control examples

### Step 7: Healthcare Compliance Validation

1. **Review against healthcare compliance framework**:
   - Re-check all HIPAA Security Rule requirements (technical safeguards)
   - Re-check all HIPAA Privacy Rule requirements (data usage limitations)
   - Update Compliance Check section in design.md
   - Document any approved exceptions with clinical justification

2. **Verify healthcare completeness**:
   - All medical requirements addressed in design
   - All PHI entities have appropriate data models with privacy controls
   - All clinical actions have HIPAA-compliant API contracts
   - All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved with regulatory consideration
   - Healthcare architecture alignment verified (if healthcare-architecture.md exists)
   - Clinical safety and patient privacy measures documented

3. **Create healthcare summary**:
   - Update design.md Executive Summary with healthcare focus
   - List all generated artifacts with compliance status
   - Document next steps (implementation, security review, clinical validation)

### Step 8: Commit Healthcare Design Artifacts

1. **Stage all healthcare design files** (replace N-feature-name with actual feature branch name):

   ```bash
   git add specs/N-feature-name/design.md
   git add specs/N-feature-name/research/research.md
   git add specs/N-feature-name/data-model.md
   git add specs/N-feature-name/contracts/
   git add specs/N-feature-name/quickstart.md
   git add specs/N-feature-name/compliance-check.md
   ```

2. **Create commit with 'feat:' prefix**:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add HIPAA-compliant technical design for N-feature-name"
   ```

3. **Report completion**:
   - List all generated artifacts with paths
   - Confirm HIPAA compliance status
   - Confirm commit completed
   - Note current branch
   - Suggest next steps (security review, clinical validation, task breakdown)

## Examples

### Example 1: Patient Portal Authentication

**Input**:

```
Design HIPAA-compliant patient portal authentication with multi-factor authentication
```

**Process**:

1. Create design/design.md from healthcare template
2. Healthcare Technical Context identifies: PHI access controls, authentication strength, audit logging
3. Research.md documents: HIPAA authentication requirements, MFA for medical data, OAuth2 for healthcare
4. data-model.md defines: Patient entity with PHI, AuthenticationLog entity, access control relationships
5. contracts/ includes: POST /auth/patient-login, POST /auth/mfa-verify, GET /auth/patient-session
6. quickstart.md outlines: MFA implementation, PHI encryption, audit trail setup

**Output**: Complete HIPAA-compliant design package in specs/N-feature-name/ directory, committed to git

### Example 2: EHR Medication Management Integration

**Input**:

```
Integrate medication management with hospital EHR system using FHIR
```

**Process**:

1. Load compliance-framework.md for HIPAA requirements
2. Healthcare Technical Context: FHIR Medication resources, PHI in medication data, clinical safety
3. Research: FHIR medication profiles, EHR integration patterns, medication reconciliation workflows
4. Data model: Medication, Prescription, Administration entities with clinical relationships
5. Contracts: FHIR MedicationRequest, MedicationAdministration resources with privacy headers
6. Quickstart: FHIR client setup, medication safety checks, integration testing procedures

**Output**: FHIR-compliant medication management design, aligned with clinical safety standards, ready for implementation

## Edge Cases

### Missing Compliance Framework

- **Case**: Project doesn't have compliance-framework.md
- **Handling**: Stop process, require compliance framework creation first using project-ground-rules-setup skill

### PHI Data Classification Conflicts

- **Case**: Requirements conflict with PHI classification rules
- **Handling**: Document conflict in design.md, consult compliance officer, propose alternative design

### Incomplete Medical Requirements

- **Case**: Healthcare spec lacks critical clinical details
- **Handling**: Add to NEEDS CLARIFICATION, create research tasks to fill medical gaps, document clinical assumptions

### Third-Party Healthcare API Dependencies

- **Case**: Feature depends on external healthcare API (EHR, pharmacy, insurance)
- **Handling**: Research API thoroughly, document HIPAA Business Associate Agreement requirements, include fallback strategies

### Complex Clinical Workflows

- **Case**: Medical process has many clinical states and decision points
- **Handling**: Create detailed clinical workflow diagram in data-model.md, document all valid transitions, include error recovery states

## Error Handling

### Healthcare Research Incomplete

- **Error**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remain after healthcare research phase
- **Action**: Return to research phase, conduct deeper clinical investigation, consult medical experts if needed

### HIPAA Compliance Violation

- **Error**: Design conflicts with mandatory HIPAA requirements
- **Action**: Stop design process, document violation, revise design to comply or get regulatory approval

### Missing Healthcare Prerequisites

- **Error**: Required healthcare context files (feature spec, compliance-framework.md) not found
- **Action**: Report missing files, request user to provide or create them first

### Invalid Healthcare API Contract

- **Error**: Generated FHIR/HL7 schema has validation errors
- **Action**: Review contract structure, fix schema syntax, validate against healthcare standards

### Incomplete PHI Data Model

- **Error**: Healthcare entities missing privacy controls or audit requirements
- **Action**: Review HIPAA requirements again, add missing PHI protection details, ensure all clinical data interactions documented

## Guidelines

1. **Always use absolute paths** when referencing files
2. **ERROR and stop** if HIPAA violations cannot be justified
3. **Document all healthcare decisions** with clinical rationale in research.md
4. **Align with healthcare architecture** when healthcare-architecture.md exists
5. **Generate complete HIPAA-compliant contracts** - don't leave TODOs in medical API specifications
6. **Validate schemas** against healthcare standards before committing
7. **Use healthcare templates provided** in templates/ directory for consistency
8. **Commit with 'feat:' prefix** for healthcare design documentation
9. **Mark medical unknowns clearly** with "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" during initial analysis
10. **Resolve all clarifications** with regulatory consultation before moving to design phase
