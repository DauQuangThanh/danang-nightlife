# Task Management Skill

## Overview

This skill generates comprehensive implementation task lists (`tasks.md`) from design artifacts. It transforms high-level specifications into actionable, dependency-ordered tasks organized by user story, with clear parallelization opportunities and independent test criteria.

## When to Use

- Breaking down feature specifications into implementation tasks
- Creating implementation roadmaps from design documents
- Generating dependency-ordered task lists
- Planning feature development phases
- Organizing tasks by user story priority
- Identifying parallelizable implementation work
- User mentions: "create tasks", "implementation plan", "task breakdown", "feature decomposition"

## Prerequisites

- **Design artifacts in feature directory**:
  - `design.md` (tech stack, libraries, structure) - **Required**
  - `spec.md` (user stories with priorities) - **Required**
  - `data-model.md` (entities) - Optional
  - `contracts/` (API endpoints) - Optional
  - `research.md` (decisions) - Optional
  - `quickstart.md` (test scenarios) - Optional
- **Product-level documentation**:
  - `docs/architecture.md` (architectural patterns, ADRs, deployment) - Optional
- **Tools**: Python 3.6+ for running prerequisite checks

## Instructions

### Step 0: Technical Design and Specification Verification

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always verify technical design and specifications exist before creating task breakdown.**

1. **Request technical design documents:**
   - Ask the user to confirm that technical design is complete
   - Verify the location of `design.md` in the feature directory
   - Verify the location of `spec.md` with user stories and priorities
   - Ask if the design has been reviewed and approved

2. **Check for required design artifacts:**
   - Confirm `design.md` exists with:
     - Technology stack and libraries
     - Project structure and code organization
     - Architectural decisions and patterns
   - Confirm `spec.md` exists with:
     - User stories with clear priorities (P1, P2, P3...)
     - Acceptance criteria for each story
     - Clear requirements and constraints

3. **Verify supporting documentation:**
   - Check if `data-model.md` exists (for data-driven features)
   - Check if `contracts/` directory exists (for API implementations)
   - Check if `docs/architecture.md` exists (for architectural alignment)
   - Note what's available to inform task generation

4. **Review and confirm scope:**
   - Summarize the feature to be implemented
   - Review user story priorities and dependencies
   - Clarify the expected task breakdown structure
   - Ask about any specific implementation preferences or constraints

5. **Only proceed to Step 1 after:**
   - Technical design document (`design.md`) exists and is reviewed
   - Specification document (`spec.md`) with user stories exists and is reviewed
   - Design and specifications are confirmed as complete and approved
   - User confirms readiness to generate task breakdown

### Step 1: Check Prerequisites and Get Feature Directory

Run the prerequisite check script to identify the feature directory and available design documents:

**Python:**

```bash
python skills/task-management/scripts/check-prerequisites.py --json
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**

```powershell
cd C:\path\to\repo
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File skills/task-management/scripts/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json
```

Parse the output to extract:

- `FEATURE_DIR`: Absolute path to feature directory
- `AVAILABLE_DOCS`: List of available design documents

### Step 2: Load Design Documents

Read design artifacts from `FEATURE_DIR` in this order:

1. **design.md** (Required):
   - Extract tech stack and libraries
   - Extract project structure and code organization
   - Extract architectural decisions

2. **spec.md** (Required):
   - Extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
   - Extract acceptance criteria for each story
   - Note story dependencies

3. **docs/ground-rules.md** (If exists):
   - Extract mandatory project constraints (MUST/SHOULD rules)
   - Note compliance and security requirements that affect task generation
   - These constraints take precedence over all other documents when planning tasks

4. **docs/architecture.md** (If exists):
   - Extract architectural patterns
   - Extract deployment requirements
   - Extract relevant ADRs for implementation

5. **data-model.md** (If exists):
   - Extract entities and relationships
   - Map entities to user stories that need them

6. **contracts/** directory (If exists):
   - List all contract/endpoint files
   - Map endpoints to user stories

7. **research.md** (If exists):
   - Extract technical decisions
   - Extract setup requirements

8. **quickstart.md** (If exists):
   - Extract test scenarios
   - Map scenarios to user stories

9. **docs/e2e-test-plan.md** (If exists):
   - Extract E2E test scenarios relevant to each user story
   - Include test implementation tasks when generating user story phases
   - Map test scenarios to user stories for test task generation

### Step 3: Generate Tasks

Create tasks.md following this structure:

#### Phase Organization

**Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization)**

- Project structure creation
- Dependency installation
- Configuration setup
- If architecture.md exists: Infrastructure aligned with deployment architecture

**Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)**

- Shared infrastructure that ALL user stories need
- Common utilities and base classes
- Core middleware or services
- MUST complete before any user story implementation

**Phase 3+: User Story Phases (In Priority Order)**

- One phase per user story (P1, P2, P3...)
- Each phase is independently testable
- Within each story phase:
  1. Tests (if requested in spec)
  2. Models/Entities needed for that story
  3. Services/Business logic for that story
  4. Endpoints/UI for that story
  5. Integration tasks for that story

**Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns**

- Documentation
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Cross-story integration

#### Task Format (CRITICAL)

Every task MUST follow this exact format for AI implementation:

```
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Action verb + specific component + in precise/file/path.ext
```

**Format Components:**

1. **Checkbox**: Always `- [ ]`
2. **Task ID**: Sequential (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if parallelizable (different files, no dependencies)
4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story tasks
   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3]
   - Setup phase: NO story label
   - Foundational phase: NO story label
   - User Story phases: MUST have story label
   - Polish phase: NO story label
5. **Description**: Use action verbs + specific details + precise paths

**AI Implementation Requirements:**

- **Action Verbs**: Use clear verbs: Create, Implement, Add, Update, Configure, Write, Build
- **Specific Components**: Name exact classes, functions, endpoints (e.g., "UserModel class", "login() function", "/api/auth endpoint")
- **Precise Paths**: Full relative paths from project root (e.g., `src/models/user.py`, not just "models")
- **Context**: Include what the component does or implements
- **Dependencies**: Reference design artifacts (e.g., "per design.md", "from data-model.md")

**AI-Optimized Examples:**

- ✅ `- [ ] T001 Create project directory structure with src/, tests/, docs/ folders per design.md`
- ✅ `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authenticate() middleware function in src/middleware/auth.py`
- ✅ `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model class with email/password fields in src/models/user.py`
- ✅ `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService.register() method in src/services/user_service.py`
- ✅ `- [ ] T018 [US1] Add POST /api/users endpoint with request validation in src/api/users.py`
- ❌ `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID, Story label, path, specifics)
- ❌ `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox, not specific)
- ❌ `- [ ] T012 [US1] User model` (not an action, unclear what to do)

### Step 4: Use the Template

Use `templates/tasks-template.md` as the structure. Fill in:

1. **Feature name** from design.md
2. **All phases** with tasks in correct format
3. **Dependencies section** showing story completion order
4. **Parallel execution examples** per story
5. **Implementation strategy** (MVP first, incremental delivery)
6. **Architecture alignment** notes (if architecture.md exists)

### Step 5: Generate and Commit

1. Write tasks.md to the feature directory
2. Validate AI implementation readiness:
   - ALL tasks have checkboxes (`- [ ]`)
   - ALL tasks have sequential IDs (T001, T002, T003...)
   - User story tasks have [US#] labels
   - ALL tasks start with action verbs (Create, Implement, Add, etc.)
   - ALL tasks include precise file paths from project root
   - ALL tasks specify exact components/functions/classes to create
   - ALL tasks are unambiguous and actionable by AI
   - Dependencies between tasks are clear from ordering
3. Generate commit message: `docs: add implementation tasks for [feature-name]`
4. Commit the tasks.md file

### Step 6: Report Summary

Provide a summary including:

- Path to generated tasks.md
- Total task count
- Task count per user story
- Parallel opportunities identified
- Independent test criteria for each story
- Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)
- Format validation confirmation

## Task Organization Mapping

### From User Stories (spec.md)

- Each user story → Separate phase
- Map components to their story:
  - Models needed for that story
  - Services needed for that story
  - Endpoints/UI needed for that story
  - Tests specific to that story (if requested)

### From Contracts (contracts/)

- Map each endpoint → User story it serves
- If tests requested: Contract test task [P] before implementation

### From Data Model (data-model.md)

- Map each entity → User story(ies) that need it
- If entity serves multiple stories → Earliest story or Setup phase
- Relationships → Service layer tasks in appropriate story phase

### From Architecture (docs/architecture.md)

- Deployment requirements → Setup/Foundational tasks
- Architectural patterns → Implementation tasks across stories
- ADRs → Reference in task descriptions
- Directory structure → File paths in tasks

## Examples

### Example Input

**spec.md excerpt:**

```markdown
## User Stories

### P1: User Registration
As a user, I want to register an account...

### P2: User Login
As a user, I want to log in...
```

**design.md excerpt:**

```markdown
## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python/FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL

## Project Structure
- src/models/ - Data models
- src/services/ - Business logic
- src/api/ - Endpoints
```

### Example Output (tasks.md excerpt)

```markdown
## Phase 3: User Story 1 - User Registration

**Story Goal**: User can create account with email/password

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- [ ] Can POST to /api/register with valid data
- [ ] Returns 201 with user ID
- [ ] User stored in database

**Tasks**:
- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Create UserRepository in src/repositories/user_repo.py
- [ ] T012 [US1] Implement RegistrationService in src/services/registration.py
- [ ] T013 [US1] Create registration endpoint in src/api/users.py
- [ ] T014 [US1] Test registration flow end-to-end
```

## Edge Cases

- **Missing required documents**: If design.md or spec.md is missing, report error and list required documents
- **No user stories in spec.md**: Generate warning and create single implementation phase
- **Circular dependencies**: Identify and report for manual resolution
- **Ambiguous parallelization**: Mark as sequential if unclear
- **Multiple stories per component**: Place in earliest story or Foundational phase

## Error Handling

- **Script execution fails**: Report exact error, check working directory and script permissions
- **Invalid JSON from script**: Parse as text and extract feature directory manually
- **Missing design artifacts**: List what's missing and what's required vs optional
- **Invalid user story priorities**: Use document order as priority
- **Template not found**: Create tasks.md from scratch following the structure

## Scripts

This skill includes cross-platform scripts for checking prerequisites and identifying feature directories:

### Python Script (Cross-Platform)

```bash
python skills/task-management/scripts/check-prerequisites.py [--json]
```

**Features:**

- Color-coded output for human-readable mode
- JSON output with `--json` flag
- Searches multiple standard locations for feature directories
- Validates required and optional design documents

### PowerShell Script (Windows)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File skills/task-management/scripts/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json
```

**Features:**

- Color-coded output for human-readable mode
- JSON output with `-Json` switch
- Searches multiple standard locations for feature directories
- Validates required and optional design documents

### Script Output Format

Both scripts output JSON with:

- `success`: Boolean indicating if feature directory was found
- `feature_dir`: Absolute path to feature directory
- `available_docs`: Array of found design documents
- `missing_required`: Array of missing required documents
- `warning`: Warning message if required documents are missing
- `error`: Error message if feature directory not found

## Templates

- `templates/tasks-template.md`: Structure for generated tasks.md file

## Guidelines

1. **Task Completeness**: Every user story must be fully implementable and testable from its tasks
2. **Dependency Order**: Tasks within a phase should be ordered by dependency
3. **Parallelization**: Mark [P] only when truly independent (different files, no shared state)
4. **File Paths**: Always include specific file paths in task descriptions
5. **Story Independence**: Most user stories should be independently implementable
6. **MVP First**: Phase 3 (first user story) should be sufficient for MVP
7. **Tests Optional**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested or TDD approach specified
8. **Architecture Alignment**: When architecture.md exists, ensure tasks align with patterns and deployment requirements

## Validation

Before finalizing tasks.md, validate for AI implementation:

**Format Validation:**

- [ ] All tasks follow checklist format with checkboxes (`- [ ]`)
- [ ] All tasks have sequential IDs (T001, T002, T003...)
- [ ] User story tasks have [US#] labels
- [ ] All tasks include specific file paths from project root
- [ ] Format matches template structure

**AI Implementation Readiness:**

- [ ] Every task starts with clear action verb (Create, Implement, Add, Update, etc.)
- [ ] Every task specifies exact component (class name, function name, endpoint path)
- [ ] File paths are precise and unambiguous (full path from project root)
- [ ] Tasks reference design artifacts for context ("per design.md", "from spec.md")
- [ ] Dependencies between tasks are clear from sequential ordering
- [ ] Each task is independently verifiable (can check if done)

**Structure Validation:**

- [ ] Dependencies section shows story completion order
- [ ] Each user story phase is independently testable
- [ ] Parallel execution examples provided per story
- [ ] Independent test criteria are verifiable and specific

## Related Skills

**After creating the task breakdown:**

- Use `coding` skill to execute the implementation tasks
- Use `project-consistency-analysis` skill to validate consistency across all project documents and ensure the task breakdown aligns with architecture, specifications, and design decisions
- Use `code-review` skill after implementation to validate code quality

**Before creating tasks:**

- Ensure `requirements-specification` skill has been used to create feature specs
- Ensure `technical-detailed-design` skill has been used to create implementation design
- **Recommended:** Use `coding-standards` skill to establish code conventions (if not yet created)
- Consider `architecture-design` skill for product-level architecture (if not yet created)
- Consider `e2e-test-design` skill to create the product-level E2E test plan (if not yet created) — its test scenarios will inform test task generation
