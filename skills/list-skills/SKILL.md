# List Skills

## Overview

This skill lists all available skills from remote repositories configured in `nightlife.yaml`. It supports both GitHub and Azure DevOps as skill repositories. It helps users discover what skills are available for installation before using the `add-skills` skill.

## When to Use

- User wants to see available skills
- User asks "what skills are available?"
- User wants to browse the skill catalog
- Before using the `add-skills` skill to know what's available
- User mentions: "list skills", "show skills", "available skills", "skill catalog"

## Prerequisites

- `nightlife.yaml` exists in the project root with configured `skills` section
- Internet connection to reach GitHub API and/or Azure DevOps API
- `curl` available on the system (Mac/Linux) or `Invoke-RestMethod` (Windows)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read Configuration

1. Read `nightlife.yaml` from the project root
2. Parse the `skills:` section — each entry has:
   - `name`: Display name for the repository
   - `url`: Repository URL (GitHub or Azure DevOps)
   - `branch`: Git branch name (e.g., `main`)
   - `path`: Path within repo containing skills (e.g., `skills`)

Example `nightlife.yaml` (supports multiple repositories):
```yaml
skills:
  - name: DaNangNightlifeSkill
    url: https://github.com/owner/repo-a
    branch: main
    path: skills
  - name: VinhPhoenixSkill
    url: https://github.com/owner/repo-b
    branch: main
    path: skills
```

### Step 2: List Available Skills

For each skill repository entry:

**GitHub repos:**
1. Use GitHub API to list contents: `https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}?ref={branch}`

**Azure DevOps repos:**
1. Use Azure DevOps Items API: `https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_apis/git/repositories/{repo}/items?scopePath=/{path}&recursionLevel=oneLevel&...`

For both:
2. Filter for directories (skills are folders containing SKILL.md)
3. Skip hidden directories (starting with `.` or `_`)
4. Display the skill name (directory name)

### Step 3: Present Results

Display results grouped by repository:

```
Repository: {name} ({repo_url}, branch: {branch}, path: {path})
  - skill-name-1
  - skill-name-2
  - ...
  Total: N skills available

Grand total: N skills across M repositories
```

## Running the Script

Execute the listing script. The script is located in this skill's `scripts/` subdirectory. Replace `{SKILL_DIR}` with the actual path to the directory containing this SKILL.md file:

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
bash {SKILL_DIR}/scripts/list-skills.sh
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File {SKILL_DIR}/scripts/list-skills.ps1
```

For example, if this skill is installed at `.claude/skills/list-skills/`, run:
```bash
bash .claude/skills/list-skills/scripts/list-skills.sh
```

The script reads `nightlife.yaml` from the project root and lists available skills from each configured repository.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub personal access token for API requests |
| `AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT` / `ADO_TOKEN` | Azure DevOps personal access token for API requests |

## Error Handling

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| `nightlife.yaml` not found | Tell user to run `phoenix init --here --force` to restore it, or create it manually |
| GitHub API rate limit (HTTP 403) | Suggest setting `GH_TOKEN` environment variable |
| Azure DevOps auth error (HTTP 401/403) | Suggest setting `AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT` environment variable |
| Repository not found (HTTP 404) | Check the repo URL, branch, and path in nightlife.yaml |
| No skills found | The repository path may not contain skill directories |
