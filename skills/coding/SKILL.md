# Coding Skill

## Overview

This skill executes feature implementations by processing structured task lists (tasks.md), validating quality checklists, and systematically implementing code following architectural patterns, coding standards, and test-driven development practices. It emphasizes writing simple, maintainable, and readable code while managing phase-by-phase execution with proper dependency handling and progress tracking.

## When to Use

- Implementing features from task breakdowns
- Executing implementation plans systematically
- Coding from specifications and design documents
- Following TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach
- Managing phase-based implementation workflow
- Tracking implementation progress
- User mentions: "implement tasks", "execute implementation", "code feature", "follow task breakdown", "implement from tasks.md"

**Related Skills:**

- **Before coding**: Use `technical-detailed-design` and `task-management` skills for planning
- **After coding**: Use `code-review` skill for quality validation
- **Commits**: Use `git-commit` skill to generate semantic commit messages following conventional commit standards
- **During coding**: Use `bug-analysis` skill if issues discovered
- **Post-review refactoring**: Use `code-refactoring` skill if `code-review` identifies structural quality issues
- **Standards**: Use `coding-standards` skill if standards.md is missing

## Prerequisites

- **Required documents in feature directory**:
  - `tasks.md` - Task breakdown and execution plan (Required)
  - `design.md` - Technical design and architecture (Required)
  - `spec.md` - Feature requirements and user stories (Optional but recommended)
- **Product-level documentation** (Optional but recommended):
  - `docs/architecture.md` - System architecture, patterns, ADRs
  - `docs/standards.md` - Coding conventions and standards (**Recommended:** use `coding-standards` skill to create if missing)
- **Optional supporting documents**:
  - `data-model.md` - Entity definitions and relationships
  - `contracts/` - API specifications
  - `research.md` - Technical decisions
  - `checklists/` - Quality checklists
- **Tools**: bash (Unix/Linux/macOS) or PowerShell (Windows) for running prerequisite checks

## Instructions

### Step 0: Technical Design and Task Plan Verification

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always request technical design and task breakdown before starting implementation.**

1. **Request required documents:**
   - Ask the user to provide the technical design document (`design.md`)
   - Request the task breakdown file (`tasks.md`) with detailed implementation tasks
   - If missing, ask the user to provide or confirm the location of:
     - Technical specifications and design decisions
     - Implementation plan with task breakdown by phase
     - Task dependencies and execution order
     - Data models and API contracts (if applicable)

2. **Verify task breakdown completeness:**
   - Confirm `tasks.md` exists with:
     - Clear task breakdown organized by phases (Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish)
     - Task IDs and descriptions
     - File paths for each task
     - Dependencies between tasks
     - Parallelization markers ([P]) where applicable
   - Verify tasks are actionable and specific

3. **Verify technical design completeness:**
   - Confirm `design.md` exists with:
     - Technology stack and libraries to be used
     - Project structure and file organization
     - Component architecture and design patterns
     - Technical decisions and rationale
   - Check if `spec.md` (feature requirements) is available
   - Verify if product-level docs exist (`docs/architecture.md`, `docs/standards.md`)

4. **Review and confirm understanding:**
   - Summarize the feature to be implemented
   - Review the task breakdown, phases, and dependencies
   - Clarify any ambiguities in the technical design
   - Confirm the implementation approach and technology stack
   - Identify which phase or task to start with
   - Ask about any specific concerns or constraints

5. **Only proceed to Step 1 after:**
   - Technical design document (`design.md`) is provided and reviewed
   - Task breakdown (`tasks.md`) is provided and reviewed with clear phases and dependencies
   - Implementation approach is clearly understood
   - Starting point (phase/task) is confirmed
   - User confirms readiness to start implementation

### Step 1: Check Prerequisites and Load Context

Run the prerequisite check script to verify required documents exist:

**Cross-platform (Python):**

```bash
python3 skills/coding/scripts/check_implementation.py /path/to/feature --json
```

Parse the output to extract:

- `FEATURE_DIR`: Absolute path to feature directory
- `AVAILABLE_DOCS`: List of available design/spec documents
- `TASKS_FILE`: Path to tasks.md
- `CHECKLIST_STATUS`: Status of quality checklists (if exists)

### Step 2: Validate Quality Checklists (If Present)

If `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` exists, validate all checklists before proceeding. See [references/implementation-patterns.md](references/implementation-patterns.md#checklist-validation-process) for detailed validation process.

**Quick Summary:**

- Scan all checklist files and count completed vs incomplete items
- Create status table showing pass/fail for each checklist
- If all pass → proceed automatically
- If any incomplete → ask user permission to proceed or halt

### Step 3: Load Implementation Context

Read all available documents to build complete implementation context:

#### Required Documents

1. **tasks.md** (Required):
   - Extract task phases (Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish)
   - Parse task IDs, descriptions, file paths
   - Identify parallel tasks (marked with [P])
   - Extract dependencies and execution order

2. **design.md** (Required):
   - Extract tech stack and libraries
   - Extract project structure and file organization
   - Extract component architecture
   - Extract technical decisions

#### Product-Level Documents (If Available)

1. **docs/ground-rules.md** (Optional — but recommended):
   - Extract mandatory project constraints (MUST/SHOULD rules)
   - Note compliance, security, and privacy requirements
   - These constraints take precedence over architecture.md and standards.md

2. **docs/architecture.md** (Optional):
   - Extract architectural patterns and styles
   - Extract C4 model component organization
   - Extract technology stack decisions
   - Extract ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
   - Extract deployment architecture
   - Extract quality attribute requirements

3. **docs/standards.md** (Optional):
   - Extract UI naming conventions
   - Extract code naming conventions
   - Extract file structure standards
   - Extract API design standards
   - Extract database naming conventions
   - Extract testing standards
   - Extract Git commit conventions
   - Extract documentation standards

#### Supporting Documents (If Available)

1. **spec.md** (Optional):
   - Extract user stories and acceptance criteria
   - Extract requirements and constraints

2. **data-model.md** (Optional):
   - Extract entities and relationships
   - Extract data constraints

3. **contracts/** (Optional):
   - Extract API specifications
   - Extract endpoint definitions
   - Extract test requirements

4. **research.md** (Optional):
   - Extract technical decisions and rationale
   - Extract constraints and considerations

### Step 4: Project Setup Verification

Verify and create project infrastructure before implementation. See [references/implementation-patterns.md](references/implementation-patterns.md#ignore-files-management) for detailed ignore file patterns.

**Key Tasks:**

#### Architecture Alignment (If architecture.md exists)

- Verify directory structure matches code organization
- Ensure deployment configuration aligns with architecture
- Follow component organization patterns from C4 Component View

#### Standards Compliance (If standards.md exists)

- Follow file and directory naming conventions
- Apply code naming conventions (UI, backend, database)
- Follow project structure standards

#### Ignore Files Management

- Detect project technology (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
- Create/verify ignore files (.gitignore, .dockerignore, etc.)
- Apply technology-specific patterns (see references/implementation-patterns.md)

### Step 5: Parse Tasks Structure

Extract task organization from tasks.md:

**Task Structure Elements**:

- **Task ID**: Sequential identifier (T001, T002, etc.)
- **Parallel Marker**: [P] indicates task can run in parallel
- **User Story Label**: [US1], [US2], etc. for traceability
- **Description**: What to implement
- **File Path**: Where to implement it
- **Dependencies**: Order requirements

**Phase Organization**:

1. **Phase 1: Setup** - Project initialization
2. **Phase 2: Foundational** - Blocking prerequisites
3. **Phase 3+: User Stories** - Feature implementation by story
4. **Final Phase: Polish** - Cross-cutting concerns

**Execution Rules**:

- Sequential tasks must run in order
- Parallel tasks [P] can run simultaneously
- Tasks affecting same files must be sequential
- User story phases should be independently testable

### Step 6: Execute Implementation Plan

Follow phase-by-phase execution with proper workflow. See [references/implementation-patterns.md](references/implementation-patterns.md#phase-by-phase-implementation-workflow) for detailed phase workflows and execution patterns.

**Phase Overview:**

1. **Phase 1: Setup** - Project initialization and configuration
2. **Phase 2: Foundational** - Shared infrastructure and base classes
3. **Phase 3+: User Story Implementation** - Feature implementation using TDD:
   - Tests first (if requested)
   - Models/Entities
   - Services/Business Logic
   - Endpoints/UI
   - Integration
   - Validation
4. **Final Phase: Polish** - Documentation, optimization, security

**Task Execution Rules** (see [references/implementation-patterns.md](references/implementation-patterns.md#task-execution-rules)):

- Respect dependencies (sequential vs parallel tasks)
- Handle errors appropriately (halt on critical, continue on parallel)
- Track progress (update tasks.md, report status)
- Commit frequently (after each logical unit, use proper prefixes)
- **Code Quality Focus**: Write simple, maintainable, and readable code:
  - Use clear variable and function names
  - Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
  - Add comments for complex logic
  - Follow established patterns and conventions
  - Avoid over-engineering; prefer straightforward solutions

### Step 7: Completion Validation

Verify implementation quality and completeness. See [references/implementation-patterns.md](references/implementation-patterns.md#implementation-verification-checklist) for complete validation checklist.

**Quick Checks:**

- [ ] All tasks completed (marked as [X] in tasks.md)
- [ ] Implementation matches specifications
- [ ] Tests pass (if tests implemented)
- [ ] Architecture alignment validated (if architecture.md exists)
- [ ] Standards compliance validated (if standards.md exists)
- [ ] Checklists all passed (if checklists exist)
- [ ] Code simplicity: No unnecessary complexity, clear logic flow
- [ ] Code maintainability: Well-structured, follows patterns, easy to modify
- [ ] Code readability: Clear naming, appropriate comments, consistent formatting

### Step 8: Generate Implementation Report

Create summary using `templates/implementation-report.md`:

**Report Contents**:

- Implementation date and duration
- Tasks completed count by phase
- Files created/modified
- Tests status (if applicable)
- Compliance status (architecture + standards)
- Remaining work (if any)
- Known issues or technical debt

Save report to `FEATURE_DIR/implementation-report.md`

### Step 9: Report Summary

Provide concise summary including:

- Path to tasks.md showing completion status
- Total tasks completed vs total tasks
- Phases completed
- Architecture compliance (pass/fail)
- Standards compliance (pass/fail)
- Checklist status (all passed/some incomplete)
- Next steps or recommendations

### Step 10: Quality Review (Recommended)

After completing the implementation, it's highly recommended to run additional validation. See [references/implementation-patterns.md](references/implementation-patterns.md#next-steps-recommendations) for detailed next steps.

**Recommended:**

1. **Run `code-review` skill** to validate code quality, error handling, test coverage, and security
2. **Address findings** from review before creating PR/MR
3. **Consider `e2e-test-design` skill** if E2E tests needed
4. **Use `bug-analysis` skill** if issues discovered during testing

- [references/implementation-patterns.md](references/implementation-patterns.md) - Detailed implementation patterns and workflows
- `templates/implementation-report.md` - Implementation completion report structure
- `templates/progress-tracker.md` - Progress tracking template

## Task Execution Patterns

See [references/implementation-patterns.md](references/implementation-patterns.md#task-execution-patterns) for complete patterns including:

- Sequential execution
- Parallel execution (tasks marked with [P])
- TDD execution (Tests → Implementation)

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Feature Implementation

**Input:**

```bash
bash skills/coding/scripts/check-implementation.sh --json
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "feature_dir": "/path/to/specs/feature-name",
  "tasks_file": "/path/to/specs/feature-name/tasks.md",
  "available_docs": ["tasks.md", "design.md", "spec.md"],
  "checklist_status": "all_passed",
  "task_count": 45
}
```

**Execution:**

1. All checklists passed → Proceed automatically
2. Load tasks.md, design.md, spec.md
3. Execute Phase 1: Setup (5 tasks)
4. Execute Phase 2: Foundational (8 tasks)
5. Execute Phase 3: User Story 1 (15 tasks)
6. Execute Phase 4: User Story 2 (12 tasks)
7. Execute Final Phase: Polish (5 tasks)
8. Generate implementation report

### Example 2: Implementation with Incomplete Checklists

**Checklist Status:**

```
| Checklist    | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
|--------------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
| ux.md        | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
| security.md  | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
```

**Execution:**

1. Display table showing incomplete security checklist
2. **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Proceed anyway?"
3. Wait for user response
4. If "yes" → Continue with implementation
5. If "no" → Halt and recommend completing checklists first

## Edge Cases

- **Missing tasks.md**: Report error and suggest running task generation skill first
- **Missing design.md**: Report error, cannot proceed without technical design
- **No checklists directory**: Skip checklist validation, proceed with implementation
- **Empty tasks.md**: Report error, no tasks to execute
- **Malformed tasks.md**: Attempt to parse, report specific formatting issues
- **Git repository not initialized**: Create .git if needed for ignore file management
- **Test failures during execution**: Report failures, suggest fixes, may continue or halt depending on severity
- **Conflicting standards**: Prioritize standards.md over architecture.md for naming conventions

## Error Handling

- **Script execution fails**: Report exact error, check working directory and script permissions
- **Invalid JSON from script**: Parse as text and extract file paths manually
- **Missing required documents**: List what's missing and halt execution
- **Task execution fails**: Report task ID, error message, affected files, suggest next steps
- **Test failures**: Report failed tests, log output, suggest investigation
- **Standards violation detected**: Report violation, reference standards.md section, suggest correction
- **Architecture pattern mismatch**: Report mismatch, reference architecture.md section, suggest alignment

## Scripts

This skill includes cross-platform scripts for checking implementation prerequisites:

### Bash Script (Unix/Linux/macOS)

```bash
bash skills/coding/scripts/check-implementation.sh --json
```

**Features:**

- Locates feature directory and tasks.md
- Validates checklist status
- Counts tasks by phase
- Identifies available documentation
- JSON and human-readable output

### PowerShell Script (Windows)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File skills/coding/scripts/check-implementation.ps1 -Json
```

**Features:**

- Locates feature directory and tasks.md
- Validates checklist status
- Counts tasks by phase
- Identifies available documentation
- JSON and human-readable output

### Script Output Format

Both scripts output JSON with:

- `success`: Boolean indicating if tasks.md was found
- `feature_dir`: Path to feature directory
- `tasks_file`: Path to tasks.md
- `available_docs`: Array of found documents
- `task_count`: Total number of tasks
- `checklist_status`: "all_passed", "some_incomplete", or "no_checklists"
- `checklist_details`: Array of checklist statuses (if checklists exist)
- `error`: Error message if prerequisites not met

## Templates

- `templates/implementation-report.md`: Structure for implementation completion reports
- `templates/progress-tracker.md`: Template for tracking ongoing implementation progress

## Guidelines

1. **Follow TDD**: Tests before implementation when tests are required
2. **Respect Dependencies**: Never skip dependency order
3. **Mark Progress**: Update tasks.md after each completed task
4. **Commit Frequently**: Commit after each logical unit of work; use `git-commit` skill for semantic commit messages
5. **Apply Standards**: Follow standards.md conventions consistently
6. **Align with Architecture**: Respect architectural patterns from architecture.md
7. **Validate Quality**: Check against checklists before and after implementation
8. **Document as You Go**: Add inline comments and documentation while coding
9. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Provide clear context for debugging
10. **Report Progress**: Keep user informed of implementation status

## Success Criteria

An implementation is complete when:

- [ ] All tasks in tasks.md marked as [X]
- [ ] All required phases completed
- [ ] Tests pass (if tests were implemented)
- [ ] Code matches specifications from spec.md
- [ ] Architecture alignment validated (if architecture.md exists)
- [ ] Standards compliance validated (if standards.md exists)
- [ ] Checklists all passed (if checklists exist)
- [ ] Implementation report generated
- [ ] All changes committed with appropriate messages
- [ ] No critical errors or blockers remain
