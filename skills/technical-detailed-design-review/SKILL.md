## Instructions

### Step 1: Check Prerequisites and Locate Design Documents

Run the prerequisite check script to verify design documentation exists and identify all design artifacts:

**Python 3 (Cross-platform):**

```bash
python3 /path/to/technical-detailed-design-review/scripts/check-design.py --json
```

**Note**: Replace `/path/to/technical-detailed-design-review` with the actual path where this skill is located:

- Global installation: `~/.copilot/skills/technical-detailed-design-review`
- Project installation: `.github/skills/technical-detailed-design-review`
- Or wherever your agent stores skills (see agent-skills-folder-mapping.md for your specific tool)

Parse the output to extract:

- `design_file`: Path to main design.md
- `research_file`: Path to research.md
- `data_model_file`: Path to data-model.md
- `contracts_dir`: Path to contracts directory
- `quickstart_file`: Path to quickstart.md
- `feature_spec`: Path to feature specification
- `ground_rules_file`: Path to ground-rules.md (if exists)
- `architecture_file`: Path to architecture.md (if exists)

### Step 2: Load Design Documents and Supporting Context

Read all design documentation and supporting files:

1. **Load core design documents**:
   - `design.md` - Main implementation plan
   - `research.md` - Research findings and decisions
   - `data-model.md` - Entity and data model definitions
   - All files in `contracts/` directory - API specifications
   - `quickstart.md` - Implementation guide (if exists)

2. **Load supporting context** (if available):
   - Feature specification for requirement traceability
   - `ground-rules.md` for constraint validation
   - `architecture.md` for architectural alignment
   - Any referenced external documentation

3. **Note the following**:
   - Identify all "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" markers
   - Extract all "TODO" or "ACTION REQUIRED" items
   - List all referenced external files

### Step 3: Execute Technical Design Review Workflow

Perform comprehensive review following the template structure in `templates/technical-detailed-design-review-template.md`.

For detailed checklists, see [references/review-checklist.md](references/review-checklist.md).

#### Review Phase 1: Document Completeness

Check if all required sections and documents are present and complete:

- Main Design Document (design.md): Executive summary, feature context, technical context, implementation approach, technology choices, file structure, testing strategy, deployment considerations, timeline
- Research Document (research.md): Research findings, decisions with rationale, architecture alignment, trade-offs, references
- Data Model Document (data-model.md): Entity definitions, field specifications, relationships, state machines, diagrams
- API Contracts (contracts/*.md): Endpoint coverage, HTTP methods, request/response schemas, authentication, error handling
- Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md): Implementation steps, technology stack, key files, code examples, integration points, testing approach

#### Review Phase 2: Research Validation

Validate research findings for quality and completeness:

- Each decision has clear problem statement, explicit choice, rationale, alternatives considered
- Architecture alignment documented
- Trade-offs captured with advantages and disadvantages
- No unresolved questions or "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" markers
- Consistent terminology throughout
- External dependencies and technical risks identified

#### Review Phase 3: Data Model Validation

Validate data models for correctness and completeness:

- **Entity Definitions**: All domain concepts covered, clear naming, no redundancy
- **Field Specifications**: All fields defined with types, constraints, defaults, nullable handling
- **Relationships**: All relationships defined with cardinality, foreign keys, cascade behavior
- **State Management**: States enumerated, transitions mapped, triggers identified
- **Validation Rules**: Business rules captured, input validation specified, error messages defined

#### Review Phase 4: API Contract Validation

Validate API contracts for completeness and consistency:

- **Endpoint Design**: RESTful conventions, consistent naming, appropriate HTTP methods, idempotency, versioning
- **Request Specifications**: Path parameters, query parameters, request body schema, required fields, content-type
- **Response Specifications**: Success responses, response body schema, pagination, HTTP status codes
- **Error Handling**: Error response format, error codes, error messages, validation errors, HTTP error codes
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Auth requirements, mechanisms, authorization rules, token format
- **Schema Validation**: Valid JSON/YAML, type consistency, backward compatibility

#### Review Phase 5: Requirements Traceability

Verify all requirements are addressed in the design:

- **Functional Requirements**: Each requirement covered with entities, endpoints, and implementation approach
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability, availability, monitoring documented
- **User Stories/Use Cases**: User flows documented with endpoints, data flow, and error scenarios

#### Review Phase 6: Ground Rules Compliance

Validate design adheres to project constraints and standards (if ground-rules.md exists):

- Compliance verified for each ground rule
- Exceptions documented and justified
- Common checks: technology stack, security standards, data privacy, API standards, error handling, logging, testing requirements

#### Review Phase 7: Architecture Alignment

Verify design aligns with established architecture (if architecture.md exists):

- Architectural patterns, container selection, component responsibilities
- Communication patterns, technology choices, data flow, integration patterns, deployment model
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) reviewed and followed

#### Review Phase 8: Implementation Feasibility

Assess whether the design is implementable:

- **Technical Feasibility**: No blockers, dependencies available, technologies mature, performance realistic, complexity manageable
- **Team Capability**: Skills available, reasonable learning curve, sufficient documentation, good support
- **Timeline Realism**: Estimate provided and reasonable, dependencies identified, risk buffer included

#### Review Phase 9: Quality and Clarity

Assess overall quality of the design documentation:

- **Writing Quality**: Clear language, consistent terminology, no ambiguity, no TODOs, proper formatting
- **Completeness**: No missing sections, all questions resolved, all references valid, examples provided
- **Diagrams**: Present where appropriate, accurate, and readable

### Step 4: Generate Review Report

Create a comprehensive review report using the template:

1. **Prepare review report**:
   - Use template from `templates/technical-detailed-design-review-template.md`
   - Fill in all review sections with findings
   - Document all issues found (critical, major, minor)

2. **Categorize findings**:
   - **Critical**: Must fix before implementation (missing requirements, ground rules violations)
   - **Major**: Should fix before implementation (incomplete sections, unclear decisions)
   - **Minor**: Nice to have (formatting, minor clarifications)

3. **Provide recommendations**:
   - Specific actions to address each finding
   - Priority order for fixes
   - Suggestions for improvement

4. **Create summary**:
   - Overall assessment (Pass, Pass with Conditions, Needs Revision)
   - Count of issues by severity
   - Key strengths of the design
   - Most critical items to address

### Step 5: Report Findings

Present the review findings to the user:

1. **Summary First**:
   - Overall assessment
   - Total issue count by severity
   - Key highlights (strengths and critical issues)

2. **Detailed Findings**:
   - List all issues found
   - Group by review phase
   - Include specific file/line references
   - Provide clear recommendations

3. **Actionable Next Steps**:
   - Prioritized list of actions
   - Suggested order of fixes
   - Estimated effort for revisions

4. **Positive Feedback**:
   - Highlight what's done well
   - Acknowledge good practices
   - Note comprehensive sections

## Examples

### Example 1: Complete Design Review

**Input**: Review design for user authentication feature

**Process**:

1. Run check-design script, finds all design files
2. Load design.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
3. Execute all review phases
4. Find issues:
   - Critical: Password hashing algorithm not specified in research.md
   - Major: Token refresh flow missing from API contracts
   - Minor: Some field descriptions could be more detailed
5. Generate review report with recommendations

**Output**: Comprehensive review report with 1 critical, 1 major, 3 minor issues, overall assessment: "Pass with Conditions"

### Example 2: Design with Ground Rules Violation

**Input**: Review payment processing design

**Process**:

1. Check prerequisites, load all documents including ground-rules.md
2. Review ground rules compliance
3. Find violation: Design uses non-approved payment gateway
4. Check if exception is documented - No exception documented
5. Flag as critical issue

**Output**: Review report with critical ground rules violation, recommendation: "Document exception with justification and obtain approval, or switch to approved payment gateway"

### Example 3: Incomplete Research

**Input**: Review API integration design

**Process**:

1. Load all design documents
2. Review research.md validation
3. Find issues:
   - Multiple "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" markers still present
   - API rate limits not researched
   - No alternatives considered for webhook handling
4. Flag as critical - Phase 0 not complete

**Output**: Review report indicating design is not ready for implementation, must complete research phase first

## Edge Cases

### Missing Design Documents

- **Case**: Required design files (design.md, research.md, data-model.md) not found
- **Handling**: ERROR and report which files are missing, suggest running technical-detailed-design skill first

### Design in Progress

- **Case**: Design contains many "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" or "TODO" markers
- **Handling**: Report design is incomplete, list all unresolved items, recommend completing design before review

### No Ground Rules or Architecture

- **Case**: Project doesn't have ground-rules.md or architecture.md
- **Handling**: Skip those validation phases, note in report that compliance couldn't be verified

### Conflicting Documentation

- **Case**: Design contradicts requirements or architecture
- **Handling**: Flag as critical issue, document specific conflicts, recommend resolution

### Multiple API Contract Files

- **Case**: Many contract files in contracts/ directory
- **Handling**: Review each file individually, check for consistency across contracts

### Complex State Machines

- **Case**: Entity has very complex state transitions
- **Handling**: Request state diagram, verify all transitions are valid, check for unreachable states

## Error Handling

### Prerequisites Check Failed

- **Error**: check-design script reports missing files or returns error
- **Action**: Report specific missing files, provide path to expected location, suggest creating files first

### Invalid JSON Output

- **Error**: Script output is not valid JSON or missing required fields
- **Action**: Fall back to manual file discovery, document the script error, suggest script fix

### Unreadable Design Documents

- **Error**: Design files exist but are corrupted or have invalid Markdown
- **Action**: Report which file is problematic, suggest file restoration or recreation

### Ground Rules Violation Without Exception

- **Error**: Design violates ground rule but no exception documented
- **Action**: Flag as critical issue, require documentation of exception with justification, or design revision

### Missing Requirements

- **Error**: Cannot find feature specification to validate against
- **Action**: Report missing spec, suggest creating specification first, or request path to specification

### Architecture Conflict

- **Error**: Design conflicts with established architecture patterns
- **Action**: Document specific conflict, recommend aligning with architecture or proposing ADR for exception

## Guidelines

1. **Be thorough**: Review all sections and validate all claims
2. **Be specific**: Reference exact files, sections, and line numbers in findings
3. **Be constructive**: Provide actionable recommendations, not just criticisms
4. **Be fair**: Acknowledge good practices and complete sections
5. **Prioritize**: Categorize issues by severity (critical, major, minor)
6. **Check traceability**: Verify all requirements are addressed
7. **Validate compliance**: Check ground rules and architecture alignment
8. **Assess feasibility**: Consider implementation realism
9. **Report clearly**: Use structured format from template
10. **Use absolute paths**: Always reference files with full paths
